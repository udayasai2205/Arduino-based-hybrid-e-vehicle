This project endeavors to engineer an electric vehicle (e-vehicle) endowed with
sophisticated safety mechanisms and multi-modal control interfaces. The primary
goal is to fabricate a versatile platform capable of dynamic obstacle detection via
ultrasonic sensors, precise motor control utilizing Pulse Width Modulation (PWM),
seamless remote manipulation facilitated by Bluetooth communication employing
the HC-05 module, and intuitive command recognition through voice control.
Integration of ultrasonic sensors enables the e-vehicle to engage in real-time
environmental perception, facilitating autonomous navigation and efficient
obstacle avoidance strategies. Leveraging PWM techniques, the system achieves
precise control over motor speed and direction, ensuring optimal performance and
energy utilization. The incorporation of the HC-05 Bluetooth module establishes a
robust communication link between the e-vehicle and external devices, enabling
seamless remote control and data exchange. Furthermore, the implementation of
voice recognition algorithms empowers users with intuitive interaction capabilities,
augmenting accessibility and user experience. Through rigorous testing and
validation procedures, the e-vehicle demonstrates exceptional adaptability and
reliability across diverse operational modalities, underscoring its potential to
revolutionize mobility paradigms in various application domains.
